3. Inventories:
    - Is a single file.
    - Is a list of all remote machine.
    - Contain information of remote machine (IP, database, ..)
    - New machine need to be registered into it.
4. Playbooks:
    - YAML.
    - Set of instruction what should be done.
    - Contains many plays (one play contains many modules)
